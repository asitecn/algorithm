Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

Examples:
pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.
Notes:
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.
