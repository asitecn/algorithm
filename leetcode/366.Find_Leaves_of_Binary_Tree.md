Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:
Given binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:
1. Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:

          1
         / 
        2          
2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:

          1          
3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:

          []         
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].
