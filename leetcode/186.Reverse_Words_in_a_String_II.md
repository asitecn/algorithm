Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
