Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies: Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

Example 1:

nums: [1,2,3]

Result: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
Example 2:

nums: [1,2,4,8]

Result: [1,2,4,8]
